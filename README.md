 ## Overview of the Project

 ### project: Implement Caesar Cipher

 ### Objective

This project involves the implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classical cryptographic technique used for basic data encryption and decryption.
The application is developed in Python and enables users to securely transform text by shifting characters using a user-defined key.
The project provides a practical understanding of encryption concepts and serves as an introductory exercise in cybersecurity fundamentals.

### Key Activities

Understanding the Caesar Cipher algorithm
Designing logic for encryption and decryption
Accepting user input for message, shift value, and mode
Implementing character shifting using Python
Testing the program with multiple input values
Validating output and handling edge cases

 ### Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Concepts: Cryptography basics, Caesar Cipher
Tools: Python Interpreter, VS Code / IDLE / Terminal
Domain: Cyber Security
